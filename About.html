<h2>Physical activity background</h2>
<p>
    Pregnancy is one of the most important and priority field concerning the obstacles which an individual has to face. It is one of the most important and critical time in the life of women. Physical activity is one of the essential vital aspects of pregnancy. Physical activity helps in proper metabolism in the body. Several studies show that it is good to do some amount of physical activity during pregnancy. <br>The quantitative perspective of this research paper is to find the overall experiences of overweight and obese pregnant women and how to deal with the difficulties they might face during pregnancy. In spite of this, research also shows that because of less physical activity by the women during their pregnancy period leads to further reduced physical activity during the post-pregnancy stage.

<p> In short, we advise pregnant women to do a reasonable amount of physical activities. They should be given proper information about the level of physical activities and their effects on the mother and the child. Much research and study are required to have appropriate and adequate information about the type and level of activity they need to do. Also, one should know the obstacles of performing each activity so that they donâ€™t have to face any consequence. Therefore, we advise midwives to do more physical activities.
