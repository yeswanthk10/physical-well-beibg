<h1>1. Get Good Sleep</h1>
Obtaining the full recommended number of hours of sleep each night (between 7-9 hours) is paramount to successful weight loss.

When you are overly tired, your body becomes lethargic which sends a signal to your brain that this exhaustion is actually due to lack of food.
Your brain thinks, “Uh oh, better send some hunger pangs to the stomach as a warning.” Hence, you crave more food, and often overeat, to provide you with energy.
<h2>2. Don’t Skip Meals</h2>
While you may think this is an effective way to cut back on your calorie intake, it actually backlashes every time. Calories are not a source of evil. If calories come from wholesome, real foods, you will be adequately nourished and have less cravings. Here’s the ugly downward spiral when you skip a meal:

You are essentially starving your body and causing your hunger to increase until it becomes an insurmountable force.
This often leads to eating double or triple the amount of food at your next meal.

Eat breakfast to kickstart your metabolism each morning.
<h3>3. Eat Breakfast Everyday</h3>
Mum was right that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

Eating breakfast is necessary to balance your blood sugar and boost your energy.

When you sleep, your metabolism slows and does not increase until after you have eaten your first meal of the day.
To jumpstart your metabolism in the morning, eat at least 200 calories within two hours of waking. Try one of our Paleo Pancake Recipes to kickstart your day the healthy way!
<h4>4.Avoid Binge Eating</h4>
Yes, self control and discipline is important when implementing a healthy diet.

If you are craving several pieces of cake, it’s probably wise not to go there. (Unless you’ve just had a miserable week and need to let loose… in that case, heck, have at it!).

What’s really important on a day-to-day basis, is that you do not deprive yourself so much that you regularly binge.

Here’s how it works:

If you are really craving a chocolate bar, you should enjoy one chocolate bar. Dark, organic chocolate can actually lower stress and be a healthy source of magnesium.
Substituting carrot sticks or a granola bar won’t satisfy the craving and may result in you overeating by adding a chocolate bar anyway.
<h5>5. Make Healthy Food Swaps</h5>
There’s no need to dump out your entire pantry and fridge to start a healthy diet.

Simple swaps can make an enormous difference.

Skip the butter in mashed potatoes and add flavorful vegetables and spices instead.
Switch your cow’s milk with almond or coconut milk.
Lose the fried foods and choose to bake or broil.
<h6>6. Try a New Healthy Food Each Week</h6>
Have you ever reached a diet plateau?

Healthy eating does not have to be bland or boring.

It’s crucial to be creative with your meals and have fun with them.

Experiment by adding a health food to your meals, like quinoa or chia seeds, that you’ve never eaten. You may find you love the new addition of flavor, and if not, scratch it off the shopping list! Are you eating these 10 superfoods for healthy weight loss?
Don’t worry about the cost of organic, nutritious foods. Even Walmart and Target offer local and organic produce at affordable prices.
