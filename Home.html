<p>A state of physical well-being is not just the absence of disease. It includes lifestyle behavior choices to ensure health, avoid preventable diseases and conditions, and to live in a balanced state of body, mind, and spirit.</p>
<p>Increasing your well-being is simple; there are tons of skills you can build. But increasing your well-being is not always easy: Figuring out what parts of well-being are most important for you and figuring out how, exactly, to build well-being skills usually require some extra help.</p>

<p>Usually when people start consistently using science-based techniques for enhancing well-being, they begin to feel better pretty quickly. In the studies I've conducted and read, most people show significant improvements within five weeks.

But you have to stick to it. If you are feeling better after five weeks, you can't just stop there.

Why? Well, you probably already know that if you stop eating healthy and go back to eating junk food, then you'll end up back where you started. It turns out that the exact same thing is true for different types of well-being. If you want to maintain the benefits you gain, you'll have to continue to engage in well-being-boosting practices to maintain your skills. So it's really helpful to have strategies and tools that help you stick to your well-being goals — for example, a happiness and well-being plan or a well-being boosting activity that you can continue to use throughout your life.</p>

<h2>Healthy habits</h2>

<p>As a factor that influences the correct growth and development both physically and mentally of children, a varied and balanced diet is essential.Breakfast is one of the fundamental meals for children because it gives them the energy they need in order to face a day full of activities. Therefore, let’s see what a balanced breakfast should contain.</p>
<p>A well-nourished child has more energy to learn and develop an adequate physical ability. Playing sports, then, is essential for children to grow up happy and healthy. Today, children are accustomed to spending time in front of a screen when their bodies need to be more active, so we must work extra hard to ensure that our little ones are playing sports and spending time outdoors as much as possible.

How do we instill these habits?<br>
We teach through example. Instilling healthy habits in our children will lead to both short and long term improvements in their quality of life and, as a result, they will live a healthier life into adulthood. We can ensure this healthier life by…<br>
1. Introducing one or two habits at a time; it is not advisable to introduce all the desired changes all at once. Instead, once these one or two habits are assimilated, move on to the following ones.<br>
2. Teaching through example; demonstrate activities such as walking all together, eating healthy, or washing our hands before eating, etc. Participating in these healthy habits as well will show the little ones understand that these habits are not punishments, but actions of a healthy life that we all do together.<br>
3. Reinforcing the habits we want to instill without creating anxiety; eliminate negative phrases such as “Do not do this, do not eat that …” and replacing them with positive ones like “This is delicious, let’s go for a walk …”<br>
4. Teaching the bases of a balanced diet enthusiastically and interactively; include your children in the preparation of meals and share the reasons behind your healthy choices.<br></p>
